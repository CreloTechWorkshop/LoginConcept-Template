Important security note
-------------------------

In the default setup the database - which is only a simple users.db file - can be downloaded directly. To prevent this, change the path of your database file! A path that is not accessable by public is perfect. The .htaccess in the project only works if you have set AllowOverride to All in your vhost / apache config.


Short guide
-------------------------

The index.php does all the action, please look into the code for more info, everything is commented. The install script _install.php creates a database (a file named users.db) right into the root folder. The .htaccess protects your database file from being downloaded. The password_compatibility_library.php is only loaded automatically when you use a PHP version older than 5.5 to add the new PHP 5.5 password hashing functions to these older PHP versions. The _debug.php is a little helper tool, it simply echoes out the content of the database.
